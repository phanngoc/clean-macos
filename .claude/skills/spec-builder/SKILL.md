4. **After Generating tasks.md**:
   - Extract tasks to CSV for tracking: `python track_progress.py extract <tasks.md>`
   - Use `python track_progress.py next` to get the next task to implement
   - Use `python track_progress.py implement <task_id>` to start working on a specific task
   - Mark tasks as done: `python track_progress.py done <task_id>`

   - Mention target users and use cases

2. **Let the Skill Work**
   - The skill will guide you through all three phases
   - Ask clarifying questions if needed
   - Iterate on each document

3. **Review and Refine**
   - Review generated documents
   - Request modifications or additions

### Example Invocation

```
Use spec-builder to generate a full spec for:
"Implement user authentication with 2FA, email verification, 
and session expiry handling in our web app."
```

### What You'll Get

After running this skill, you'll have three comprehensive documents:

1. **requirements.md** - Clear user stories and acceptance criteria
2. **design.md** - Technical architecture and component design
3. **tasks.md** - Detailed implementation tasks ready for developers

These documents are optimized for:
- Human developers to understand the system
- AI coding agents (Cursor, Copilot) to implement tasks
- Product teams to validate requirements
- Stakeholders to review scope and approach

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### When Creating Requirements
- Focus on WHAT, not HOW
- Make acceptance criteria testable
- Include both positive and negative cases
- Consider accessibility and internationalization

### When Creating Design
- Start high-level, then drill down
- Document WHY decisions were made
- Consider scalability from the start
- Think about error cases and edge conditions

### When Creating Tasks
- Keep tasks small and focused
- Make dependencies explicit
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Provide enough context for independent work

### Quality Checklist
- ✅ Can a developer implement this without asking questions?
- ✅ Can QA create test cases from the requirements?
- ✅ Can an AI agent understand the task breakdown?
- ✅ Are trade-offs and risks documented?
- ✅ Is the scope clear (what's included and excluded)?

## 📝 Output File Organization

After running this skill, organize output files as:

```
project-root/
├── .claude/
│   └── specs/
│       └── [feature-name]/
│           ├── requirements.md
│           ├── design.md
│           └── tasks.md
```

Or place them in a dedicated specs directory:

```
project-root/
├── docs/
│   └── specs/
│       └── [feature-name]/
│           ├── requirements.md
│           ├── design.md
│           └── tasks.md
```

---

## 📊 Task Progress Tracking

After generating `tasks.md`, you can use the built-in tracking system to monitor implementation progress.

### Setup Tracking

1. **Extract tasks from tasks.md to CSV**:
```bash
cd .claude/skills/spec-builder/scripts
python track_progress.py extract ../../specs/[feature-name]/tasks.md
```

This will parse all tasks from `tasks.md` and save them to `tasks.csv` with their metadata (category, complexity, dependencies, etc.).

### Track Progress

**View overall progress**:
```bash
python track_progress.py progress
```

**List all tasks**:
```bash
python track_progress.py list
```

**List tasks by status**:
```bash
python track_progress.py list --status=pending
python track_progress.py list --status=in_progress
python track_progress.py list --status=done
```

**List tasks by category**:
```bash
python track_progress.py list --category=Backend
```

### Mark Tasks

**Mark a task as done**:
```bash
python track_progress.py done <task_id>
```

**Update task status**:
```bash
python track_progress.py status <task_id> <status>
# Statuses: pending, in_progress, done, blocked
```

### Get Task for Implementation

**Get next available task** (respects dependencies):
```bash
python track_progress.py next
```

**Get specific task for implementation**:
```bash
python track_progress.py implement <task_id>
```

This command will:
- Mark the task as `in_progress`
- Display full task details
- Show the task's dependencies and requirements

### Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Extract tasks from newly generated tasks.md
python track_progress.py extract ../../specs/my-feature/tasks.md

# 2. Check overall progress
python track_progress.py progress

# 3. Get next task to implement
python track_progress.py next

# 4. After implementing, mark as done
python track_progress.py done 5

# 5. Check progress again
python track_progress.py progress
```

### CSV Structure

The `tasks.csv` file contains:
- `task_id`: Task number from tasks.md
- `title`: Task title
- `category`: Task category (Backend, Frontend, Testing, etc.)
- `status`: Current status (pending, in_progress, done, blocked)
- `complexity`: Task complexity (Low, Medium, High)
- `estimated_time`: Time estimate
- `dependencies`: Comma-separated list of dependent task IDs
- `spec_path`: Path to the tasks.md file
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp
- `notes`: Optional notes about the task

### Integration with Implementation

When implementing a task:

1. **Get the task**:
   ```bash
   python track_progress.py implement <task_id>
   ```

2. **Read the full task details** from `tasks.md` using the task_id

3. **Implement the task** following the acceptance criteria

4. **Mark as done**:
   ```bash
   python track_progress.py done <task_id>
   ```

The tracking system automatically:
- Preserves task status when re-extracting from tasks.md
- Respects task dependencies when suggesting next tasks
- Tracks progress by category and overall completion

---

## 🔄 Iteration and Updates

This skill can also help you:

- **Refine existing specs**: Provide an existing spec document and ask to improve it
- **Update for changes**: When requirements change, update all three documents
- **Generate partial specs**: Only generate requirements or design if that's what you need
- **Compare approaches**: Generate multiple design options for evaluation

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

A good spec generated by this skill should:

1. **Be Complete**: Cover all aspects from requirements to implementation
2. **Be Clear**: Anyone can understand without additional context
3. **Be Actionable**: Tasks can be implemented immediately
4. **Be Testable**: Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
5. **Be Maintainable**: Easy to update as requirements evolve

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: The generated spec is too detailed**
A: Ask to generate a "lightweight" or "minimal" version

**Q: Need more technical depth**
A: Request "detailed technical design with code examples"

**Q: Tasks are too large**
A: Ask to "break down tasks into smaller sub-tasks of 2-4 hours each"

**Q: Need specific format**
A: Specify your organization's format: "Use our company's standard template"
